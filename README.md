# titanic_project

A simple data analytics project , with help of the python numpy,pandas, and matplotlob analyses the data of the titanic!
tells you the various survival rates of different scenarios, and plots a few graphs (tried my best with very basic data analysis knowledge)
does not use any machine learning algorithms



FUTURE : 
will use prediction models using ML


Edit(1) :
Will shorten the unnecessary long codes by using lambda functions.

Edit(2):
Added a new file implementing linear regression using gradient descent to predict survival of a passenger
